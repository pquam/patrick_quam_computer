        I listened to The Seven Habits as an audiobook. I decided to read it when I saw it in the library catalogue,
        and remembered hearing about it on either the Cortex or Hello Internet podcast (I knew it was CGP Grey, I just couldn't remember where).
        The Seven habits was an interesting read, from the perespective of someone who is both new to the workplace, not a parent, and not religious.
        While it is not necessarily the intention or the focus of the book, the examples he provides often are oriented around those areas; business management,
        parenting or marrriage, and how the habits are common sentiments shared across religions, even if the wording and presentation varies.
        While I may not be have the intended target of the examples that Covey uses, the book does a good job of making you think about how the seven habits
        really can apply to anyone (at least in first world countries).

      <li>The Seven habits are as follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Be proactive</li>
        <p>
          Being proactive is the most common point across the few business and productivity oriented books I have read, and for good reason.
          Compared to the other books, however, the seven habits takes a very broad approach to being proactive, encouraging readers to be proactice
          in all aspects of life, including but also expand beyond business practices. Be proactive in your relationships, your hobbies, in fitness.
          Being proactive will not only make you feel happier in the moment, it also gives the benefit of "giving you a longer life", in the sense that
          someone that is proactive will almost certainly achieve more in life than someone that is only participating in urgent tasks.
        </p>
        <li>Begin with an end in mind</li>
        <p>
          This habit is the standard method of goal setting. Simply put, what do you want to achieve?
        </p>
        <li>Put first things first</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Think win-win</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Seek first to understand, then to be understood</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Synergize</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Sharpen the saw</li>
        <p>
          This habit is essentially just a reminder to be consious of what you are doing, how you are acting, and how you sepnd your time.
          Do your actions reflect the seven habits? What areas do you need to put your focus?
