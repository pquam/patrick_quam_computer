        I read this book because I know of Reggie from memes that were popular from my childhood, such as 'The Regginator',
         but also because I knew Reggie played a significant part in developing a number of games and consoles that I had devoted my time too.
         Outside of seeing him in a few E3 presentations, though, I really new very little of him, so I decided to read the book to better understand
         what it was about him, and Nintendo, that made their games so fun.

        The book follows Reggie's family and personal history. There is a lot of important and emotional backstory,
         however I think it is important for individuals to read the book for themselves to understand the paradime that Reggie experiences the world through.
         My main takeaways from the book was that it is possible to be a very prolific, enthusiastic, and effective corparate leader, and still have a heart
         and a life outside of your buisness. While I mainly read the book from the perspective of a Nintendo fanboy, I ended up learning a lot about 
         product design and buisness.
