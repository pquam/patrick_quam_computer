                      Welcome to my personal website, which primarily serves as my digital notebook and a playground for exploring a wide range of intriguing topics in computing, such as
                      low level Computer Hardware Repair, Computer Networking, Software and Web Development, Cyber Security, DevOps, Cloud/Systems Administration, and various roles in the Data Center landscape.
                      While I had the assistance of ChatGPT in some areas, I did a majority of the development myself.
                      The website you're viewing is hosted on a Virtual Private Server, which I personally set up and manage alone.
                      This involves hardening and configuring both the VPS and the web server, automating common tasks using bash scripts, and ensuring timely SSL certificate renewals with Certbot via cron jobs. 
                         I also run a local beta version of the website on a custom server I designed and built. The production and beta versions of the webside are managed using git and GitHub.
                          Through the development of the website, I've deepened my understanding of Linux, automation, server operations, DNS, and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                          As the site evolves, I aim to delve deeper into the details of how modern software is deployed. This includes tools like Azure CI/CD pipelines, current web frameworks such as HTMX, and various aspects of present day cyber security.
                           I also hope that the resources and notes on the website may be useful for other people trying to learn about technology. ðŸ™‚
