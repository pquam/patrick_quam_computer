            <li>Are both single mode and multi mode cables generally terminated in pairs?</li>
      
            <ul class="spaced-list">
              
              <li><mark>Internet Explanation:</mark> Yes, both single-mode and multi-mode fiber optic cables are generally terminated in pairs. This is because most fiber optic communication is full-duplex, meaning that data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously.

                One fiber in the pair is used to transmit data signals, and the other is used to receive them. This is why you'll often see fiber optic cables and connectors referred to as "duplex" (e.g., duplex LC or duplex SC), and why patch cables often have two connectors at each end.
                
                However, it's worth noting that there are also "simplex" fiber optic cables and connectors, which consist of a single fiber and are used for applications that only require one-way data transmission. But these are less common than duplex configurations in most networking environments.</li>

            <li id="fqdn">What is an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name), and how is it different from a URL?</li>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
              <li><mark>Internet Explanation:</mark> FQDN stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name. It's a complete and unambiguous domain name that specifies an exact location in the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy. This means it includes all higher levels of the DNS structure, not just the host and domain name.

                An FQDN consists of several parts:
                
                Hostname: The name assigned to a device connected to a computer network.
                Domain name: The name that represents an organization or entity on the internet.
                Top-level domain (TLD): The highest level of the domain structure (like .com, .org, .net, .gov, etc.)
                For example, in the FQDN "www.example.com":
                
                "www" is the hostname
                "example" is the domain name
                "com" is the top-level domain</li>
              <li><mark>Internet Explanation:</mark> Both FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are used to find resources on the internet, but they serve different purposes and contain different types of information.

                FQDN is like the full name of a specific computer or server on the internet. It's used to identify a specific machine in a network. For example, "www.example.com" is an FQDN where "www" is the hostname, "example" is the domain name, and "com" is the top-level domain.
                
                URL, on the other hand, is like a full address that tells your web browser exactly where to find a specific resource on the internet. It includes the protocol (like HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, and often a specific page or file on that domain. For example, "https://www.example.com/homepage.html" is a URL.
                
                In this URL:
                
                "https" is the protocol, which tells your browser how to access the resource.
                "www.example.com" is the FQDN, which tells your browser where the server is located.
                "/homepage.html" is the specific file or page on that server.</li>
                <li><mark>My Explanation:</mark> FQDN is the full term for what is commonly referred too simply as a domain name. FQDN is specifically a domain name that includes a hostname (or subdomain), the domain itself, and its top level domain (or TLD). It is designed to point to a specific machine on the network, or more commonly, the internet. For example, <a href="https://patrick.quam.computer" class="link">patrick.quam.computer</a> would be a FQDN. A URL is a link to a specific resource on a device, and as such the FQDN is part of a url. <a href="#" class="link">https://patrick.quam.computer.notes/other.html</a> is a url, which includes, but is not, a FQDN.</li>

            <li id="single-multi-mode-fiber">How do single mode and multi mode fiber connect to fiber transceivers? Do the transceivers have sc or lc connectors and you just need to make sure you buy the transceiver for the kind and length of cable you have?</li>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
              <li><mark>Internet answer:</mark> Most modern transceivers will use LC connectors because they are smaller size. When choosing a transceiver there are 4 main things to consider:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The type of fiber optic cable (single-mode or multi-mode) you're using.</li>
                <li>The data rate that you need to support.</li>
                <li>The distance the signal needs to travel.</li>
                <li>The type of connector on your fiber optic cable.</li>
              </ol>
              <li id="transceiver-info">Other technical considerations when choosing cabling and transceivers:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Different transceivers operate at different wavelengths, typically 850nm for multi-mode fibers and 1310nm or 1550nm for single-mode fibers. The wavelength is important because it determines the type of light source (LED or laser) and the type of photodetector used in the transceiver.</li>
                <li>The power budget of a fiber optic link is the maximum amount of power loss that a signal can tolerate while still maintaining acceptable signal quality. It's determined by the difference between the minimum transmitter power and the minimum receiver sensitivity. When designing a fiber optic link, you need to ensure that the total power loss (caused by factors such as cable length, connectors, and splices) doesn't exceed the power budget.</li>
                <li>Dispersion is a phenomenon that causes the signal to spread out over time, which can degrade signal quality. Single-mode fibers can suffer from chromatic dispersion, while multi-mode fibers can suffer from modal dispersion. Some types of transceivers use techniques such as dispersion compensation to mitigate the effects of dispersion.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <li>What are chromatic and modal dispersion?</li>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
              <li>Chromatic Dispersion: This type of dispersion occurs in single-mode fibers and is caused by the different speeds at which different wavelengths (colors) of light travel through the fiber. In an optical fiber, light doesn't travel at exactly the same speed for all wavelengths. This slight variation can cause different wavelengths to arrive at the receiver at slightly different times, which can cause the signal to spread out or disperse. This is particularly relevant for systems that use multiple wavelengths of light (DWDM systems, for example).</li>
              <li>Modal Dispersion: This type of dispersion occurs in multi-mode fibers. In a multi-mode fiber, light can take multiple paths (or modes) down the fiber, and these different paths can have different lengths. This means that light taking one path might arrive at the receiver before light taking a different path, which can cause the signal to spread out or disperse. This is one of the reasons why multi-mode fibers are typically used for shorter distances.</li>

            <li id="ssd-physical-storage">How is data physically stored on SSDs?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Data in a Solid State Drive (SSD) is stored in NAND flash memory chips. These chips are made up of many memory cells, which are the smallest units that can store data. The physical storage of data in these cells is based on the principles of electrical engineering and quantum mechanics.</li>
              <li>Each memory cell in a NAND flash memory chip is essentially a field-effect transistor. It has a control gate and a floating gate, separated by an oxide layer.</li>
              <li><mark>Data is stored in these cells by trapping or removing electrons from the floating gate.</mark> When a high voltage is applied to the control gate, electrons in the substrate (the semiconductor material) are given enough energy to cross the oxide layer and get trapped in the floating gate. This process is called "programming" or "writing" data.</li>
              <li>To read the data, a medium voltage is applied to the control gate. This causes a current to flow through the transistor. The amount of current depends on how many electrons are trapped in the floating gate. By measuring this current, the SSD's controller can determine whether a "0" or a "1" is stored in the cell.</li>
              <li>To erase data, a high voltage is applied to the substrate, causing the electrons in the floating gate to gain enough energy to cross the oxide layer and return to the substrate. This process is called "erasing" data.</li>
              <li>Modern SSDs often use multi-level cells (MLCs) or triple-level cells (TLCs) to store more than one bit of data per cell. They do this by trapping different amounts of charge in the floating gate to represent different states. For example, an MLC can store 2 bits of data by using 4 states: no charge, low charge, medium charge, and high charge.</li>
