      Racks, enclosures, &amp; unit sizes
     </h3>
     <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
      <li>
       Servers deployed in enterprise are generally stored in racks. These are monolithic cases designed to store several physical devices.
      </li>
      <li>
       Servers are often mounted to the rack using rails. Server rails allow the hardware to be slid in out of the rack without having to remove it fully. This makes hardware maintenance much more convenient for technicians. Alternatively, some devices are mounted to the rack using more permanent solutions, such as rack studs, or bolts.
      </li>
      <li>
       Generally a rack will contain servers, switches, battery backups, and potentially a KVM (keyboard, Video, Mouse) unit.
      </li>
      <li>
       Some racks, will have or require a special cooling system. Some times this can be as simple as a rack mountable fan, or could be as complex as a full water cooling distribution system.
      </li>
      <li>
       Many racks will have a dedicated mounting point for antistatic bracelets so that work can be done on the hardware installed in the rack without worrying about causing damage to components.
      </li>
      <li>
       While the depth of a rack can vary, the width and spacing between mount points on the rack are standardized.
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        The unit of space between mounting points on a rack is referred to as a 'U'. 1 U is equivalent to 1.75 inches or 4.45cm. For example, a 24u rack would have 24 mounting points. A 2u server would take up 2 of those 24 mounting points.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       Not all servers are enclosed in racks. Many servers are stored in standalone enclosures. These enclosures are effectively just normal computer cases.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="powering-servers">
      Powering Servers
     </h3>
     <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
      <li>
       It's is generally good practice to have all computing equipment powered by a surge suppressor at the very least. Servers, however, have much higher requirements for uptime.
      </li>
      <li>
       Small scale servers for personal use should at the very least be connected to an Uninteruptable Power Supply (UPS). This way, if power to the system is lost, there will at least be time for data to finish writing to the disk if necessary, or provide enough time for the system to safley shut down.
      </li>
      <li>
       Many servers wil have redundant power supplies. this means that one power supply could fail outright and the system would still be able to operate as if nothing happened. This also provides time for system administrators to identify what may have caused the failure or replace the broken hardware as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
       Ideally, servers of any importance should have their redundant power supplies connected to seperate UPS's, which would then be connected to outlets on seperate breakers. This way, even if a breaker gets tripped somewhere, the system will still be recieving power.
      </li>
      <li>
       At a large scale, such as an enterprise or data center scale, it may be worth having 2 seperate utility providers provide power to the building. This will help spread the massive electrical load of a huge server farm, as well as provide redundancy, so even if one major power source goes down, your servers will still be able to operate as expected.
      </li>
      <li>
       The standard power cable for modern desktop computers is the C13 power cable (C13 for male C14 for female). This standard is the same for server equipment.
      </li>

      Network Cabling &amp; Fiber
     </h3>
     <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
      <li>
       The standard cabling used to connect devices to a network is Ethenet. Ethernet is a copper based - twisted pair cable, generally designed to handle short to medium distance runs between devices.
      </li>
      <li>
       For applications that require higher bandwidth than ethernet is capable of, fiber optic cabling should be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>
       Fiber optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can be a problem with copper cables. This makes fiber optic cables a good choice for environments where EMI could be an issue.
      </li>
      <li>
       There are several types of fiber optic cable, which are intended for different applications. There are two common connectors, Subscriber Connector (SC) and Lucent Connector (LC). There are also two different kinds of cables, multimode and single mode.
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        SC vs LC
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         SC cables are an older standard, which is slowly being replaced by LC. There is no difference between the cables bandwidth, just the way the cabling connects to devices.
        </li>
        <li>
         The SC connector is a push-pull type connector that is larger in size, while the LC connector is a smaller form-factor connector that uses a latch as opposed to a push-pull system.
        </li>
        <li>
         LC connectors are half the size of SC connectors. This smaller size allows LC connectors to fit into denser port configurations, making them a popular choice for modern high-density applications.
        </li>
        <li>
         SC connectors are generally easier to insert and remove thanks to their push-pull design. LC connectors, on the other hand, use a latch mechanism which can be a bit more difficult to handle, especially in high-density applications.
        </li>
        <li>
         SC connectors have a square shape and are often used for mulitmode fiber, while LC connectors have a compact, modular design and can be used for single or mulitmode fiber.
        </li>
        <li>
         LC connectors are more expensive than SC connectors due to their smaller, more complex design.
        </li>
        <li>
         Both SC and LC connectors use a physical contact (PC) interface. This means that the two fiber ends in the connector physically touch each other.
        </li>
        <li>
         Both SC and LC connectors can be used with single-mode and multi-mode fiber cables.
        </li>
       </ul>

          More information on Single and Multimode fiber
         </a>
        </li>
        <li>
         The main difference between single-mode and multi-mode fiber cables is the size of the core, which is the part of the fiber that carries light. Single-mode fiber has a small core (about 9 micrometers in diameter) that allows light to travel in a single path, or mode. Multi-mode fiber, on the other hand, has a larger core (usually 50 or 62.5 micrometers) that allows light to travel in multiple paths, or modes.
        </li>
        <li>
         Both single-mode and multi-mode fiber optic cables are generally terminated in pairs. This is because most fiber optic communication is full-duplex, meaning that data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously. One fiber in the pair is used to transmit data signals, and the other is used to receive them. This is why you'll often see fiber optic cables and connectors referred to as "duplex" (e.g., duplex LC or duplex SC), and why patch cables often have two connectors at each end.
        </li>
        <li>
         There are also "simplex" fiber optic cables and connectors, which consist of a single fiber and are used for applications that only require one-way data transmission, but are less common than duplex configurations in most networking environments.
        </li>
        <li>
         Single-mode fiber cables are typically used for long-distance transmissions. Single-mode fiber optic cables can support distances of up to 100 kilometers without requiring a signal repeater. Multi-mode cables, on the other hand, are typically used for shorter distances, usually less than 2 kilometers.
        </li>
        <li>
         Single-mode fiber can support higher data rates than multi-mode fiber. This is because the single light path eliminates the signal dispersion that can occur with multi-mode fiber, allowing the signal to travel faster and further.
        </li>
        <li>
         Single-mode fiber is generally more expensive than multi-mode fiber. The equipment needed for single-mode fiber, such as lasers, is also more expensive than the equipment needed for multi-mode fiber, which can use less expensive light sources like LEDs.
        </li>
        <li>
         Single-mode fiber is typically used for long-distance applications, including telecommunications and cable TV networks. Multi-mode fiber is typically used for shorter distances, such as within a building or campus, and is commonly used for data and audio/visual applications in local-area networks (LANs).
        </li>
        <li>
         Single-mode and multi-mode fibers are often color-coded to help distinguish between them. Single-mode fiber is typically color-coded yellow, while multi-mode fiber is typically color-coded orange (for 62.5/125 µm) or aqua (for 50/125 µm).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>
       Fiber optic cables connect to devices using an interface called a transceiver. There are several Options when it comes to picking a transceiver:

        <a class="link" href="/notes/other#transceiver-info" target="_blank">
         More information on Transceivers
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable): The original SFP, also known as mini-GBIC, is a compact, hot-pluggable transceiver used for both telecommunication and data communications applications. It can support speeds up to 1 Gbps (Gigabit per second) and can be used with both fiber optic and copper cables.
       </li>
       <li>
        SFP+ (Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus): SFP+ is an enhanced version of the SFP that supports data rates up to 10 Gbps. SFP+ has the same physical form factor as SFP but can handle much higher data rates. SFP+ supports 8 Gbit/s Fibre Channel, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and Optical Transport Network standard OTU2.
       </li>
       <li>
        QSFP (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable): QSFP transceivers are designed to carry Serial Attached SCSI, 40G Ethernet, QDR (40G) and FDR (56G) Infiniband, and other communications standards. QSFP transceivers increase the port-density by placing 4 transceivers in the space that was once used for a single SFP transceiver.
       </li>
       <li>
        QSFP+ (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus): QSFP+ is an evolution of QSFP to support higher data rates, typically 40 Gbps. It is used extensively in data centers due to its high data density and lower costs compared to using individual SFP+ transceivers.
       </li>
       <li>
        QSFP28: QSFP28 is a hot-pluggable transceiver module designed for 100G data rate. QSFP28 integrates 4 transmit and 4 receiver channels. "28" means each lane carries up to 28G data rate. QSFP28 can do 4x25G breakout connection, 2x50G breakout, or 1x100G depending on the transceiver type.
       </li>
       <li>
        CFP (C Form-factor Pluggable): The CFP (C form-factor pluggable) transceiver is a multi-source agreement to produce a common form-factor for the transmission of high-speed digital signals. The c stands for the Latin letter C used to express the number 100 (centum), since the standard was primarily developed for 100 Gigabit Ethernet systems.

      Server Hardware Components:
     </h3>
     <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
      <h4>
       Motherboard
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        The motherboard is the backbone that connects all of the components of a computer together.
       </li>
       <li>
        When a computer is turned on, the first thing that happens is the motherbaord runs POST (Power On Self Test) to validate that all the hardware is installed correctly. Many motherboards will have onboard displays or speakers that indicate the progress of the POST test using specific codes.
       </li>
       <li>
        After POSt, the motherboard will hand over control of the system to either BIOS (Basic input/output System) or EUFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         BIOS is the original firmware used in PCs. When you turn on your computer, the BIOS first performs a self-test to make sure all the hardware components are working correctly. It then locates and reads the boot loader program from the boot device (such as a hard drive or a USB stick). The boot loader then loads the operating system into memory, and the operating system takes over from there. BIOS is an older technology with limitations, such as a maximum bootable storage size of 2.1 TB and slower boot times.
        </li>
        <li>
         UEFI is a newer type of firmware that was developed to overcome the limitations of BIOS. It can handle larger storage sizes (up to 9.4 ZB), and it supports features like secure boot, which can protect the boot process from malicious code. UEFI also has a more user-friendly interface (with mouse and keyboard support), and it can support remote diagnostics and repair, even without an operating system. UEFI firmware can also boot from large GPT (GUID Partition Table) disks, whereas BIOS can only boot from MBR (Master Boot Record) disks.
        </li>
        <li>
         In general, UEFI is more modern and has more features than BIOS, but both essentially serve the same purpose: they initialize the hardware and start the process of loading the operating system when you turn on your computer. Most modern PCs use UEFI, but they often include a "legacy" or "compatibility" mode that allows them to emulate BIOS for older operating systems.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4>
       CPU (Central Proccessing Unit)
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        CPU clock speed: indicates how fast the cpu runs in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). Most modern CPU's are measured in GHz (Billions of cycles per second). Higher clock speed means more instructions completed per second.
       </li>
       <li>
        CPU cores: indicates how many tasks the CPU is designed to be able to handle simultaneously.
       </li>
       <li>
        As clock speed and core count increase, CPU's will require more power and generate more heat (within the same generation of CPU. Newer CPU's may be able to have better specifications with the same power and thermal requirements).
       </li>
       <li>
        CPU cache is very high speed memory built directly onto the CPU. It is designed to be "cheaper" to access than RAM or long term storage, as in it requires less time or energy to access. Modern CPUs will typically have 3 "layers" of cache:
       </li>
       <ol>
        <li>
         This is the smallest cache (typically 32-64KB per core) but the fastest to access. It's located on the CPU chip itself and is the first place the CPU looks for data and instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
         This is larger than the L1 cache (typically 256KB - 2MB per core), but slower to access. If data is not found in the L1 cache, the CPU next looks in the L2 cache.
        </li>
        <li>
         This is larger still (typically 2-8MB shared across all cores), but slower to access. If data is not found in the L2 cache, the CPU next looks in the L3 cache. If the data is not found in the L3 cache, the CPU finally looks in the main system memory (RAM).
        </li>
       </ol>
      </ul>
      <h4>
       GPU (Graphics Proccessing Unit)
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        GPU's are proccessors dedicated to handling parrallel computing tasks, such as completing repeated calculations.
       </li>
       <li>
        A common usecase is 3d matrix math, which is used to calculate positions of objects in 3d space in applications such as modeling software. These tasks are not handled well by the CPU.
       </li>
       <li>
        GPU's will generally have their own RAM, however some systems will have their GPU built into the CPU (commonly referred to as an APU or Accelerated Proccessing Unit), which will share some amount of the system ram between the CPU and GPU.

       RAM (Random Access Memory)
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        RAM is non-persistant memory, meaning as soon as it looses power, all of the data stored in RAM is lost.
       </li>
       <li>
        RAM is high speed memory designed to store data for an application while it is in use.
       </li>
       <li>
        RAM is generally connected to the motherboard directly. There are several generations of ram, which are referred to as DDR (Double Data Rate). The newest version at the time of writing is DDR5. It is important to know what version of RAM your system uses because they are physically and electrically different; a ddr4 dimm will not work in a dd5 motherboard.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are also 2 common versions of RAM, ECC (Error Correcting Code) and non-ECC. ECC RAM was formerly reserved for servers and enterprise systems but is becoming more common on consumer hardware. ECC allows the memory stick to check for errors in the data it is storing.

       Expansion Cards
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        Modern computers generally come equipped with PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) expansion slots which can be used to connect various kinds of expansion cards.
       </li>
       <li>
        Common expansion cards include NICs (Network Interface Cards), USB expansion cards, capture cards, or storage expansion cards such as HBAs (Host Bus Adapter) or PCIe "splitters" that turn one PCIe slot into several NVMe ssd slots (this may require a motherboard that supports PCIe Bifurcation).
       </li>
       <li>
        GPU's generally connect via the PCIe bus and can also be considered expansion cards.

      <h4>
       Storage
      </h4>
      <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
       <li>
        There are 2 common types of storage, HDDs (Hard Disk Drive) and SSDs (Solid State Drive).
       </li>
       <li>
        HDDs are an older standard, but are still very common.
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         Hard Drives use spinning metal platters to record data. Data is written to the disk using a "write head", which is a magnetically actuated arm that moves over the disk to read and write data.
        </li>
        <li>
         Modern hard drives will have several layers of platters with write heads in between them to increase the capacity of the drive.
        </li>
        <li>
         Hard drives are cheaper per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs so they are used in applications where mass storage in important.
        </li>
        <li>
         Hard drives' read and write speeds are effected by how fast the platters in the drive spins. Consumer drives will often be 5400rpm or 7200rpm, but enterprise drives come in 10k to 15k rpm.
        </li>
        <li>
         Hard drives have 2 common form factors: 2.5" and 3.5".
        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        SSDs are a newer technology that is becoming more and more common due it its superior reliability and speed.
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         SSDs store data on NAND-flash chips, which have no moving parts.
         <a class="link" href="/notes/other#ssd-physical-storage" target="_blank">
          More on how SSDs store data
         </a>
        </li>
        <li>
         Because there are no moving parts, they don't have a chance to break physically, and as such, generally have a longer life than HDDs.
        </li>
        <li>
         An additional aspect of having no moving parts is that SSDs do not have to wait for the disk to spin to the correct position to read data. Data on SSDs is always accessible instantly, which means that the response time when requesting data is much quicker.
        </li>
        <li>
         Due to the way SSDs store data, they have a set lifespan. This makes it easier to know when a drive needs to be replaced before data is lost.
        </li>
        <li>
         SSDs have memory controllers that keep track of where all the data is stored on the disk, and can read if off of the disk nearly instantly. This makes modern SSDs extremely fast.
        </li>
        <li>
         Because of their superior speed and reliability, SSDs are better than HDDs in almost every application. The only disadvantage is cost, it is much cheaper to buy HDDs than SSDs.
        </li>
        <li>
         Solid State Drives come in several form factors, the most common of which are 2.5" and M.2

        RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
       </li>
       <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
        <li>
         RAID is a technology used to combine disks to improve either speed or reliability. There are several ways to combine disks to get different effects.
        </li>
        <ul >
         <li>
          RAID 0 (Striping): This level splits data evenly across two or more disks with no parity information for redundancy. It's intended to increase the system's performance, as multiple disks are reading and writing data, which can significantly improve speed. However, it offers no fault tolerance. If one drive fails, all data in the array is lost.
         </li>
         <li>
          RAID 1 (Mirroring): This level writes the same data to two drives, creating a mirrored pair. It provides high data protection by duplicating all data from one drive on another drive. The performance is good when reading but poor when writing compared to a single drive. If one drive fails, data does not get lost because it's duplicated on the other drive.
         </li>
         <li>
          RAID 5 (Striping with Parity): This level requires at least three disks and uses block-level striping with parity data distributed across all member disks. RAID 5 has good performance and fault tolerance. It can withstand a single drive failure without losing data or access to data.
         </li>
         <li>
          RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity): Similar to RAID 5, but includes a second parity block distributed across drives, offering extra fault tolerance. It can withstand the failure of two drives.

          RAID 10 (1+0): This level is a combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0, and requires a minimum of four drives. It provides the redundancy of RAID 1 along with the increased performance of RAID 0. It's often used in the server environment where both performance and security are required.
         </li>
         <li>
          RAID 50 (5+0): This level combines the straight block-level striping of RAID 0 with the distributed parity of RAID 5. It's a RAID 0 array striped across RAID 5 elements. It requires at least 6 drives.
         </li>
         <li>
          RAID 60 (6+0): This level combines the straight block-level striping of RAID 0 with the distributed double parity of RAID 6. It's a RAID 0 array striped across RAID 6 elements. It requires at least eight drives.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
         There are a few ways to implement RAID.
        </li>
        <ul >
         <li>
          Software raid (drives are configured in raid by the operating system or an application)
         </li>
         <ul >
          <li>
           Software RAID is generally less expensive than hardware RAID because it doesn't require any additional hardware beyond the drives themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
           Software RAID can be more flexible than hardware RAID. It's typically easier to modify or reconfigure, and it can support a wider variety of RAID levels.
          </li>
          <li>
           Software RAID is updated along with the operating system, ensuring that it benefits from the latest improvements and bug fixes.
          </li>
          <li>
           Software RAID uses the CPU of the host computer to manage the RAID array, which can reduce the overall performance of the system, especially under heavy load.
          </li>
          <li>
           Depending on the RAID level and the operating system, booting from a software RAID array can be complicated or even impossible.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <li>
          Hardware raid (drives are configured by a physical raid controller, which may be built into the systems motherboard or be its own expansion card)
         </li>
         <ul >
          <li>
           Hardware RAID controllers have their own processors and memory to manage the RAID array, which can result in better performance and less impact on the host system's resources.
          </li>
          <li>
           Hardware RAID controllers often support advanced features like hot swapping (replacing drives without powering down the system), RAID level migration (changing RAID levels without losing data), and battery-backed cache (which can protect data in the event of a power loss).
          </li>
          <li>
           Hardware RAID arrays are typically easier to boot from than software RAID arrays.
          </li>
          <li>
           Hardware RAID controllers can be expensive, especially high-end models with advanced features.
          </li>
          <li>
           Hardware RAID controllers are typically specific to the manufacturer and model. If the controller fails, it usually needs to be replaced with the same model, which can be difficult if it's an older or discontinued model.
          </li>
          <li>
           Hardware RAID controllers may not receive updates as frequently as software RAID, which could leave them vulnerable to bugs or compatibility issues with new drives or operating systems.

        Interface Types (common connectors for storage devices)
       </h4>
       <ul class="spaced-list hidden">
        <li>
         SCSI (Small Computer System Interface): SCSI is an older standard that uses parallel communication. It has been largely replaced by SAS and SATA in most applications. The maximum bandwidth depends on the specific version of SCSI, but the latest version (Ultra640 SCSI) can reach up to 640 MB/s. SCSI connectors are typically rectangular with a lot of pins (50, 68, or 80 depending on the version).
        </li>
        <li>
         SAS (Serial Attached SCSI): SAS is a point-to-point serial protocol that replaced parallel SCSI in many settings. SAS-3, the latest version as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, supports data rates of up to 12 Gbit/s. SAS connectors are similar to SATA connectors but have a larger "L" shape.
        </li>
        <li>
         SATA (Serial ATA): SATA is a common interface for consumer hard drives and SSDs. The latest version, SATA 3, supports data rates of up to 6 Gbit/s. SATA connectors are flat and have an "L" shape.
        </li>
        <li>
         eSATA (External SATA): eSATA is a version of SATA for external devices and supports the same data rate of up to 6 Gbit/s. eSATA connectors are similar to SATA connectors but have a slightly different shape to prevent confusion with internal SATA connectors.
        </li>
        <li>
         PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect): PCI is an older standard for connecting expansion cards to a motherboard. It has a maximum bandwidth of 133 MB/s. PCI slots are characterized by their parallel connection, which consists of one data path for the outgoing data and another for the incoming data.
        </li>
        <li>
         PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express): PCIe is a newer, faster version of PCI that uses serial communication. The bandwidth depends on the number of "lanes" (data transmission paths) the slot has. A PCIe 5 slot can reach a maximum unidirectional bandwidth of 64 GB/s (gigabytes per second), and a maximum bidirectional bandwidth of 128 GB/s. PCIe slots vary in size, from x1 (the smallest) to x16 (the largest).
        </li>
        <li>
         USB (Universal Serial Bus): USB is a common interface for many types of devices. The maximum bandwidth depends on the version: USB 2.0 supports up to 480 Mbit/s, USB 3.0 up to 5 Gbit/s, USB 3.1 up to 10 Gbit/s, and USB 3.2 up to 20 Gbit/s. USB connectors come in many shapes and sizes, including Type-A (flat and rectangular), Type-B (square), Mini and Micro USB (smaller versions for portable devices), and Type-C (small, reversible).
        </li>
        <li>
         SD (Secure Digital): SD is a type of flash memory card. The maximum bandwidth depends on the version: SD High Capacity (SDHC) supports up to 25 MB/s, and SD Extended Capacity (SDXC) supports up to 312 MB/s. SD cards are flat and rectangular with a row of contacts on one side.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h4>
        Shared Storage
       </h4>
       <ul >
        <li>
         In many applications, it's important for multiple devices to be able to access the same storage pool. Sometimes, it is just not reasonable to fit enough storage into a single device, and a dedicated storage device is necessary. In these cases, a shared storage solution is required.
        </li>
        <li>
         NAS (Network Attached Storage): This is a dedicated device that provides shared storage to a network. A NAS device is essentially a self-contained computer connected to a network, with the sole purpose of providing a large amount of storage space that can be accessed by other devices on the network. NAS devices are often used in home networks and small businesses to provide a simple way to share files among multiple computers.
        </li>
        <li>
         NFS (Network File System): This is a protocol that allows a computer to access files over a network as if they were on its local hard drive. NFS is typically used in Unix and Linux environments. It's a part of the application layer in the OSI model, which means it allows applications on a computer to read and write data to a server over a network as if the data was on the local machine.
        </li>
        <li>
         CIFS (Common Internet File System): Also known as SMB (Server Message Block), this is a protocol that provides shared access to files, printers, and serial ports over a network. It's primarily used in Windows environments, but it's also supported on Unix and Linux systems. Like NFS, CIFS operates at the application layer of the OSI model and allows applications to read and write data over a network.
        </li>
        <li>
         SAN (Storage Area Network): This is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, accessible to servers so that the devices appear as locally attached devices to the operating system. SANs are often used in data centers and large businesses for high-performance storage and recovery.
        </li>
        <li>
         iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface): iSCSI is a protocol that allows SCSI commands to be sent over IP networks. This allows for data transfers over long distances and for the building of SANs over existing infrastructure (i.e., without the need for dedicated cabling). iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval.
        </li>
        <li>
         Fibre Channel (FC): Fibre Channel is a high-speed network technology primarily used for SANs. It's most commonly used in enterprise settings where performance and reliability are critical. Fibre Channel networks can be built using optical fiber cables for long-distance communication, but they can also use copper cables for shorter distances. Fibre Channel supports multiple topologies, including point-to-point, switched, and loop configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
         FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet): FCoE is a protocol that allows Fibre Channel communications to run directly over Ethernet. This allows Fibre Channel to take advantage of 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks or higher, while preserving the Fibre Channel protocol. The main advantage of FCoE is the ability to consolidate storage and IP protocols onto a single cable, reducing complexity in the data center.
