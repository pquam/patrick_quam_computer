Ensure you are are using the latest versions of protocols to make sure data is encrypted properly. for example, sftp instead of ftp.\nlinux allows you to create dedicated accounts for services &amp; applications.This way, if a service or process becomes compromised, it is less likely to affect the rest of the system.\nIndividuals should always have their own system accounts. Users sharing accounts can make it difficult to find the source of a breach. Users have a bad habit of being less responsible with shared user accounts.\nMonitor system activity. This means regularly reviewing system logs. Sending logs to a dedicated server can help managing the review process easier, and also means you have a duplicate of logs in case an attacker changes logs on a system.\nAvoid direct logins to root and service accounts unless absolutely neccessary. Users should log in to their personal accounts then use 'sudo -u' to run commands as other users. This creates a log trail that does not exist if users sign in the application, service, or root accounts.\nWherever possible, run applications and services in their own system (container, VM, dedicated physcial hardware).Otherwise, ensure applications and services have their own dedicated user. This way, if an application or service becomes compromised, it is less likely that it will be able to effect the rest of the system.\nGeneral Security Considerations\nEnsure that single user mode is either disabled or password protected. Single user mode can be accessed by restarting the system, and provides root access to the system.\nRequire a boot menu password. Without a boot menu password, attacks can force the bootloader to boot a root shell instead of another aprt of the operating system, providing them with root access. To do so, follow these steps: Open a terminal.\nRun the command&nbsp;grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2&nbsp;. You'll be asked to enter the password and then to confirm it. This will create an encrypted password for the bootloader.\nThe command will output a hashed version of the provided password. Copy this.\nOpen the GRUB configuration file with root permissions using a text editor. For example, if you're using vim, you would enter:&nbsp;sudo vim /etc/default/grub\nFind the line that starts with&nbsp;GRUB_PASSWORD&nbsp;. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to add it. You can edit the file by entering insert mode in vim simply by inputting&nbsp;i&nbsp;. To exit vim without making changes, hit escape, then enter&nbsp;:q!&nbsp;and press enter. Set GRUB_PASSWORD to the hashed password you copied. It should look like this:&nbsp;GRUB_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512. 10000.long_string_of_characters\nSave the file and exit the text editor. If you're using vim, you can do this by pressing&nbsp;escape&nbsp;, then entering&nbsp;:wq&nbsp;to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;to confirm the file name.\nUpdate GRUB with the new configuration by running:&nbsp;sudo update-grub Ensure device encryption is enabled. Requiring a boot password can be circumvented by an attack installing their own boot media and mounting the system. LUKS is a common encryption tool. For example, if you are hosting a web server in a cloud instance, ensure the cloud instance is encrypted. additionally, you can run the server in a VM, and make sure the virtual drive for the VM is encrypted. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/order-management-sw/10.0?topic=considerations-encrypting-data-partitions-using-luks\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/order-management-sw/10.0?topic=considerations-encrypting-data-partitions-using-luks\" target=\"_self\">LUKS</a>&nbsp;is a common encryption tool. It can be used to encrypt any block device. Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL. CTRL+ALT+DEL initiates a system reboot. if an attacker is able to gain access to the system they may use the restart to gain access to the bootloader. CTRL+ALT+DEL can be disabled by running&nbsp;sudo systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target sudo systemctl stop ctrl-alt-del.target Physical Security Root user always has a user ID of 0.

Sometimes you may want to lock a user account. Maybe the account is compromised, a user no longer needs access, or it is a dedicated account for a service or application. Here are a few ways you can disable logins: Changing the final entry in a users line of the&nbsp;/etc/passwd&nbsp;file to nologin (default is /bin/bash) This can also be done by using the change shell command like this:&nbsp;chsh -s shell account For example,&nbsp;chsh -s /sbin/nologin foo&nbsp;would disable logins for the user foo. to re-enable logins, you would run&nbsp;chsh -s /bin/bash foo Another way to lock an account is with the passwd command, although this only prevents the user from logging in using a password.

Centralized Authentication Centralized authentication systems allow administrators to prevent accounts from performing any actions, including logging in if they become compromised. If an attack gains control of your centralized authentication system, they control the device. Common centralized authentication systems are freeIPA and LDAP. Intrusion prevention <br>\nIntrusion prevention systems, such as&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" target=\"_self\">fail2ban</a>&nbsp;, monitor system log files. If too many failed login attempts are detected, their IP will be blocked. fail2ban can be configured to unblock IP addresses after a set period of time, so if the \"attacker\" turns out to be a normal user that forgot their password, they will be able to regain access to the system. fail2ban can be used for any application that writes login attempts to a log file. This includes SSH and many other common applications. Disabling root logins To display all accounts with UID of 0 (root access), run&nbsp;awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd This command works by using awk, which is a text processing command. The -F: option tells awk to use a colon as the field separator, as fields in the /etc/passwd file are separated by colons. The $3 == 0 part is a condition that checks if the third field (which is the UID) is 0. If this condition is true, awk executes the action in the curly braces, which is to print the first field (the username). Any accounts with a UID of 0 should either be assigned a different UID or be removed. /etc/securetty This is a config file that contains a list of TTY devices where root is allowed to login. Leaving it blank will prevent root logins. TTY devices are 'local' terminal/console devices. Leaving a blank securetty file will not prevent remote console sessions, such as SSH. Set the root account shell to nologin. This can be done by modifying the /etc/passwd file, or ideally with the chsh command. Use&nbsp;passwd /l root&nbsp;to lock the root account password. To prevent root logins via ssh, add&nbsp;PermitRootLogin no&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file. you can prevent other users from accessing the system via SSH by adding&nbsp;DenyUsers account_names&nbsp;to the same file. Run&nbsp;systemctl reload sshd Securing System / Application Accounts Use 1 account per service. For example, if you are running an nginx web server, run that server as its own nginx user. Do not allow direct logins to system or application accounts. Use&nbsp;sudo -u&nbsp;to run commands as an application account. Deleting Accounts When an account is no longer needed, use&nbsp;userdel -r UID&nbsp;to delete the account. -r specifies to delete that users home directory. Use&nbsp;id account_name&nbsp;to find an accounts UID. After deleting a user account, you can find leftover files that belonged to that user by running&nbsp;find / -UID&nbsp;and&nbsp;find / -nouser Account Security Network Services (typically referred to as servers, or daemons) Servers &amp; daemons constantly run and the background &amp; listen on network ports. Because their output is continuous, it is typically stored in log files. Most applications will store their logs in the /var/logs directory. Daemons and servers are typically designed with a single task in mind (hosting a website, handling SSH, etc) Use a dedicated user for each application. This way, if an attacker gains control over a system, they should not be able to access the rest of the system. ports below 1024 require root privileges to open. If an application must use one of these ports, use root privileges to open the port, then drop the privileges. if a server is running on a low port, check the application configuration to see if you can specify a non-root user to perform the work. Stop &amp; uninstall all unused services. Ensure all applications are up to date with the latest security patches. Configure each service to only listen to required interfaces and addresses. For example, configure SSH to only listen to private IP addresses on the local network so that SSH is not accessable via the internet. some services, such as databases, may not need any access by network devices. In this case, configure the service to listen to the \"loopback\" adress: 127.0.0.1 Network Security Key based authentication is generally the safest way to use SSH Key based authentication can be enabled by adding&nbsp;PubKeyAuthentication yes&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file. To generate an SSH key, run&nbsp;ssh-keygen When generating a key, it is common to use&nbsp;ssh-keygen -t&nbsp;to specify what algorithm to use when generating the key. Common algorithm options are rsa and ed25519 Another common option when generating a key is&nbsp;ssh-keygen -b&nbsp;which is used to specify the number of bits in the key. A longer key means it is better protected against brute force attacks, but it also means it is more compute heavy to generate and validate. The typical length is 4096 The command should look something like&nbsp;ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096 When you generate an ssh key, it will ask you to input a password that will be required when that key is used. In some usecases, you may not want to have a password protected key. For example, if you need to automate an SSH connection, it may be unnecessarily complicated to automate password entry. When you run ssh-keygen, two files are created in that users&nbsp;~/.ssh/&nbsp;directory. Those files are id_rsa &amp; id_rsa.pub id_rsa is your&nbsp;private&nbsp;SSH key. Its permissions should be set so that only the user that generated it can access it. id_rsa.pub is your public SSH key. This will be placed in the remote hosts ~/.ssh/authorized-keys file to grant SSH access to that user. you can add a key to a remote host by running&nbsp;ssh-copy-id user@host For example&nbsp;ssh-copy-id username@1.1.1.1&nbsp;or&nbsp;ssh-copy-id username@mydomain.com SSH key authentication can be enforced by disabling password authentication by adding&nbsp;PasswordAuthentication no&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file. Disabling password authentication to SSH is generally good practice as SSH keys are effectively impossible to brute force. You should never log in directly to the root user. When setting up a remote host initially it is OK to log in as the root user to get other accounts set up, but then SSH access should quickly be disabled. To prevent root logins via ssh, add&nbsp;PermitRootLogin no&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file. If you need acccess the root user, you should do so by SSHing into your personal user, and then switching to the root user using&nbsp;sudo su - sshd_config Specific users can be granted SSH access by adding&nbsp;AllowUsers username0 username1 username 2 The same can be done for groups&nbsp;AllowGroups group0 group1 group2 Groups &amp; users can be denied SSH access by adding&nbsp;DenyUsers&nbsp;or&nbsp;DenyGroups The SSH banner should be disabled&nbsp;by adding&nbsp;Banner none&nbsp;as the information it provides may be used by attackers. Changes to sshd_config will not apply until the application has been reloaded. This can generally be done by running&nbsp;systemctl reload sshd Securing SSH<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/security/basics/\" data-href=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/security/basics/\" href=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/security/basics/\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linode Security Basics</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html\" data-href=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html\" href=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cyberciti Linux Hardening</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials\" data-href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials\" href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PortSwigger Security Materials</a>Other Security Resources<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Linux Hardening.canvas\" data-href=\"Linux Hardening.canvas\" href=\"linux-hardening.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linux Hardening</a><br><a data-href=\"General Security Considerations\" href=\"general-security-considerations.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">General Security Considerations</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Physical Security\" href=\"physical-security.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Physical Security</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Account Security\" href=\"account-security.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Account Security</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Network Security\" href=\"network-security.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Network Security</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Securing SSH\" href=\"securing-ssh.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Securing SSH</a><br><a data-href=\"Other Security Resources\" href=\"other-security-resources.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Other Security Resources</a>Linux Hardening","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Please note this is by no means an exhaustive list.

If too many failed login attempts are detected, their IP will be blocked. fail2ban can be configured to unblock IP addresses after a set period of time, so if the \"attacker\" turns out to be a normal user that forgot their password, they will be able to regain access to the system. fail2ban can be used for any application that writes login attempts to a log file. This includes SSH and many other common applications. Disabling root logins To display all accounts with UID of 0 (root access), run&nbsp;awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd This command works by using awk, which is a text processing command. The -F: option tells awk to use a colon as the field separator, as fields in the /etc/passwd file are separated by colons. The $3 == 0 part is a condition that checks if the third field (which is the UID) is 0. If this condition is true, awk executes the action in the curly braces, which is to print the first field (the username). Any accounts with a UID of 0 should either be assigned a different UID or be removed. /etc/securetty This is a config file that contains a list of TTY devices where root is allowed to login. Leaving it blank will prevent root logins. TTY devices are 'local' terminal/console devices. Leaving a blank securetty file will not prevent remote console sessions, such as SSH. Set the root account shell to nologin. This can be done by modifying the /etc/passwd file, or ideally with the chsh command. Use&nbsp;passwd /l root&nbsp;to lock the root account password. To prevent root logins via ssh, add&nbsp;PermitRootLogin no&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file. you can prevent other users from accessing the system via SSH by adding&nbsp;DenyUsers account_names&nbsp;to the same file. Run&nbsp;systemctl reload sshd Securing System / Application Accounts Use 1 account per service. For example, if you are running an nginx web server, run that server as its own nginx user. Do not allow direct logins to system or application accounts. Use&nbsp;sudo -u&nbsp;to run commands as an application account. Deleting Accounts When an account is no longer needed, use&nbsp;userdel -r UID&nbsp;to delete the account. -r specifies to delete that users home directory. Use&nbsp;id account_name&nbsp;to find an accounts UID. After deleting a user account, you can find leftover files that belonged to that user by running&nbsp;find / -UID&nbsp;and&nbsp;find / -nouser ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://patrick.quam.computer/images/etc%20shadow.jpg","fullURL":"account-security.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762602180000,"modifiedTime":1766084785808,"sourceSize":7288,"sourcePath":"Wisdom/Computers/SysAdmin-Devops/Linux Hardening/Account Security.md","exportPath":"account-security.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["linux-hardening.html"],"type":"markdown"},"general-security-considerations.html":{"title":"General Security Considerations","icon":"","description":"\nRoot user is all powerful.\nFollow a process for removing user accounts.\nroot has full control over all system processes.\nUse a firewall (ufw, iptables, dedicated firewall).\nUse Multi-Factor Authentication wherever possible.\nNEVER give root access to a user that does not absolutely require it.\nFile permissions make it easy to manage what each user has access too.\nLinux is less popular than windows 🙂, and it is open source, so less malware is developed for it.\nRoot is required to install system-wide software, configure networking, &amp; manage users, along with other administrative tasks.\nOnly allow network connections from required sources (for example, only allow incoming traffic from SSH if no other applications require network connectivity).\nCentralized package managers can certify applications are malware free before they are installed.Package managers also allow users to update all of their software at once.\nEncrypt all data transmissions over a network.

To generate an SSH key, run&nbsp;ssh-keygen When generating a key, it is common to use&nbsp;ssh-keygen -t&nbsp;to specify what algorithm to use when generating the key. Common algorithm options are rsa and ed25519 Another common option when generating a key is&nbsp;ssh-keygen -b&nbsp;which is used to specify the number of bits in the key.

The typical length is 4096 The command should look something like&nbsp;ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096 When you generate an ssh key, it will ask you to input a password that will be required when that key is used. In some usecases, you may not want to have a password protected key. For example, if you need to automate an SSH connection, it may be unnecessarily complicated to automate password entry. When you run ssh-keygen, two files are created in that users&nbsp;~/.ssh/&nbsp;directory. Those files are id_rsa &amp; id_rsa.pub id_rsa is your&nbsp;private&nbsp;SSH key.

Disabling password authentication to SSH is generally good practice as SSH keys are effectively impossible to brute force. You should never log in directly to the root user. When setting up a remote host initially it is OK to log in as the root user to get other accounts set up, but then SSH access should quickly be disabled. To prevent root logins via ssh, add&nbsp;PermitRootLogin no&nbsp;to the&nbsp;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&nbsp;file.
