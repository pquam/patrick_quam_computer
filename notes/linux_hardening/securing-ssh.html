       Key based authentication is generally the safest way to use SSH
      </li>
      <li>
       Key based authentication can be enabled by adding
       <code>
        PubKeyAuthentication yes
       </code>
       to the
       <code>
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       </code>
       file.
      </li>
      <li>
       To generate an SSH key, run
       <code>
        ssh-keygen
       </code>
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        When generating a key, it is common to use
        <code>
         ssh-keygen -t
        </code>
        to specify what algorithm to use when generating the key.
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         Common algorithm options are rsa and ed25519
        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Another common option when generating a key is
        <code>
         ssh-keygen -b
        </code>
        which is used to specify the number of bits in the key.
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         A longer key means it is better protected against brute force attacks, but it also means it is more compute heavy to generate and validate.
        </li>
        <li>
         The typical length is 4096
        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>The command should look something like <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096</code></li>
       <li>
        When you generate an ssh key, it will ask you to input a password that will be required when that key is used.
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         In some usecases, you may not want to have a password protected key. For example, if you need to automate an SSH connection, it may be unnecessarily complicated to automate password entry.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        When you run ssh-keygen, two files are created in that users  <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory. Those files are id_rsa &amp; id_rsa.pub
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         id_rsa is your <mark>private</mark> SSH key. Its permissions should be set so that only the user that generated it can access it.
        </li>
        <li>
         id_rsa.pub is your public SSH key. This will be placed in the remote hosts ~/.ssh/authorized-keys file to grant SSH access to that user.
        </li>
        <li>
         you can add a key to a remote host by running
         <code>
          ssh-copy-id user@host
         </code>
        </li>
        <li>
         For example
         <code>
          ssh-copy-id username@1.1.1.1
         </code>
         or
         <code>
          ssh-copy-id username@mydomain.com
         </code>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>
       SSH key authentication can be enforced by disabling password authentication by adding
       <code>
        PasswordAuthentication no
       </code>
       to the
       <code>
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       </code>
       file.
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        Disabling password authentication to SSH is generally good practice as SSH keys are effectively impossible to brute force.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       <mark>
        You should never log in directly to the root user.
       </mark>
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        When setting up a remote host initially it is OK to log in as the root user to get other accounts set up, but then SSH access should quickly be disabled.
       </li>
       <li>
        To prevent root logins via ssh, add
        <code>
         PermitRootLogin no
        </code>
        to the
        <code>
         /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        </code>
        file.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you need acccess the root user, you should do so by SSHing into your personal user, and then switching to the root user using
        <code>
         sudo su -
        </code>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       sshd_config
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        Specific users can be granted SSH access by adding
        <code>
         AllowUsers username0 username1 username 2
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>
        The same can be done for groups
        <code>
         AllowGroups group0 group1 group2
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>
        Groups &amp; users can be denied SSH access by adding
        <code>
         DenyUsers
        </code>
        or
        <code>
         DenyGroups
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>
        <mark>
         The SSH banner should be disabled
        </mark>
        by adding
        <code>
         Banner none
        </code>
        as the information it provides may be used by attackers.
       </li>
       <li>
        <mark>
         Changes to sshd_config will not apply until the application has been reloaded.
        </mark>
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         This can generally be done by running
         <code>
          systemctl reload sshd
         </code>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </ul>
