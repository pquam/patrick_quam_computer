       Ensure that single user mode is either disabled or password protected. Single user mode can be accessed by restarting the system, and provides root access to the system.
      </li>
      <li>
       Require a boot menu password. Without a boot menu password, attacks can force the bootloader to boot a root shell instead of another aprt of the operating system, providing them with root access. To do so, follow these steps:
      </li>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Open a terminal.
       </li>
       <li>
        Run the command
        <code>
         grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
        </code>
        . You'll be asked to enter the password and then to confirm it. This will create an encrypted password for the bootloader.
       </li>
       <li>
        The command will output a hashed version of the provided password. Copy this.
       </li>
       <li>
        Open the GRUB configuration file with root permissions using a text editor. For example, if you're using vim, you would enter:
        <code>
         sudo vim /etc/default/grub
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>
        Find the line that starts with
        <code>
         GRUB_PASSWORD
        </code>
        . If it doesn't exist, you'll need to add it. You can edit the file by entering insert mode in vim simply by inputting
        <code>
         i
        </code>
        . To exit vim without making changes, hit escape, then enter
        <code>
         :q!
        </code>
        and press enter. Set GRUB_PASSWORD to the hashed password you copied. It should look like this:
        <code>
         GRUB_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.
         10000.long_string_of_characters
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>
        Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using vim, you can do this by pressing
        <code>
         escape
        </code>
        , then entering
        <code>
         :wq
        </code>
        to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then
        <code>
         Enter
        </code>
        to confirm the file name.
       </li>
       <li>
        Update GRUB with the new configuration by running:
        <code>
         sudo update-grub
        </code>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <li>
       Ensure device encryption is enabled. Requiring a boot password can be circumvented by an attack installing their own boot media and mounting the system. LUKS is a common encryption tool.
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        For example, if you are hosting a web server in a cloud instance, ensure the cloud instance is encrypted. additionally, you can run the server in a VM, and make sure the virtual drive for the VM is encrypted.

       is a common encryption tool. It can be used to encrypt any block device.

      <li>
       Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL. CTRL+ALT+DEL initiates a system reboot. if an attacker is able to gain access to the system they may use the restart to gain access to the bootloader.
      </li>
      <ul >
       <li>
        CTRL+ALT+DEL can be disabled by running
        <code>
         sudo systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target
         <br/>
         sudo systemctl stop ctrl-alt-del.target
        </code>
