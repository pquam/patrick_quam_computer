      Network Services (typically referred to as servers, or daemons)
     </li>
     <ul >
      <li>
       Servers &amp; daemons constantly run and the background &amp; listen on network ports.
      </li>
      <li>
       Because their output is continuous, it is typically stored in log files. Most applications will store their logs in the /var/logs directory.
      </li>
      <li>
       Daemons and servers are typically designed with a single task in mind (hosting a website, handling SSH, etc)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <li>
      Use a dedicated user for each application.
     </li>
     <ul >
      <li>
       This way, if an attacker gains control over a system, they should not be able to access the rest of the system.
      </li>
      <li>
       ports below 1024 require root privileges to open. If an application must use one of these ports, use root privileges to open the port, then drop the privileges.
      </li>
      <li>
       if a server is running on a low port, check the application configuration to see if you can specify a non-root user to perform the work.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <li>
      Stop &amp; uninstall all unused services.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ensure all applications are up to date with the latest security patches.
     </li>
     <li>
      Configure each service to only listen to required interfaces and addresses.
     </li>
     <ul >
      <li>
       For example, configure SSH to only listen to private IP addresses on the local network so that SSH is not accessable via the internet.
      </li>
      <li>
       some services, such as databases, may not need any access by network devices. In this case, configure the service to listen to the "loopback" adress: 127.0.0.1
