        Sometimes you may want to lock a user account. Maybe the account is compromised, a user no longer needs access, or it is a dedicated account for a service or application. Here are a few ways you can disable logins:
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         Changing the final entry in a users line of the
         <code>
          /etc/passwd
         </code>
         file to nologin (default is /bin/bash)
        </li>
        <ul >
         <li>
          This can also be done by using the change shell command like this:
          <code>
           chsh -s shell account
          </code>
         </li>
         <li>
          For example,
          <code>
           chsh -s /sbin/nologin foo
          </code>
          would disable logins for the user foo.
         </li>
         <li>
          to re-enable logins, you would run
          <code>
           chsh -s /bin/bash foo
          </code>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
         Another way to lock an account is with the passwd command, although this only prevents the user from logging in using a password. For example, a user would still be able to log in using an SSH key.
        </li>
        <ul >
         <li>
          To lock an account:
          <code>
           passwd -l foo
          </code>
         </li>
         <li>

        Disabling root logins
       </li>
       <ul >
        <li>
         To display all accounts with UID of 0 (root access), run
         <code>
          awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
         </code>
        </li>
        <ul >
         <li>
          This command works by using awk, which is a text processing command. The -F: option tells awk to use a colon as the field separator, as fields in the /etc/passwd file are separated by colons. The $3 == 0 part is a condition that checks if the third field (which is the UID) is 0. If this condition is true, awk executes the action in the curly braces, which is to print the first field (the username).
         </li>
         <li>
          Any accounts with a UID of 0 should either be assigned a different UID or be removed.
