                    <ul>
                      <li>When building a website, ideally you dont want to have every page show .html at the end. Here are a few steps to stop that from happening.</li>
                      <ol>
                        <li>First, you will want to open <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> in your editor or choice. In nginx.conf, you are looking for your <code>location /</code> block. If you do not see it, check to see if nginx.conf included other files by default, as it may be in another included file such as <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code></li>
                        <li>In the location / block, by default there will be the line: <code>try_files $uri $uri/ =404;</code> and if there is not you should add it to be the first line in the block.</li>
                        <li>If it is not there already, add to that line <code>$uri.html</code> so the whole line will be <code>try_files $uri $uri/ $uri.html =404;</code></li>
                        <li>Create a new location block below the location \ block with the name <code>~ \.html$</code></li>
                        <li>In the new block, add <code>rewrite ^(.*)\.html$ $1 permanent;</code></li>
                        <li>The two location blocks should now look something like this:<br>
<code><pre>
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ $uri.html =404;
}

location ~ \.html$ {
  rewrite ^(.*)\.html$ $1 permanent;
}</pre></code>
                        </li>
                        <li>After reloading nginx via <code>sudo systemctl reload nginx</code> the webpage should no longer show .html extensions.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </ol>
