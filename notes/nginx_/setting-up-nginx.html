        <h3>User Account Setup</h3>

        <ol class="spaced-list">
          <li>Log in to the root user if you didn't set up a personal user account during the OS installation / configuration proccess.</li>
          <li>If you dont already have one, Create a personal user account <code>sudo adduser username</code> with a secure password. Then, give it sudo permsission by running <code>sudo visudo</code> and adding <code>username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</code> where username is the username for your personal account. This account can be accessed via SSH, and can use <code>sudo</code> to perform administrative tasks.</li>
          <li>Create a <code>nginx</code> user account with minimal permissions. This account should also be set to <code>nologin</code> and should not be accessible via SSH. This is can be done by running a command such as <code>sudo useradd -r -u 999 -s /sbin/nologin nginx
          </code> and then adding <code>DenyUsers nginx</code> to the <code>/etc/shh/sshd_config</code> file.</li>
          <li><mark>Changes to sshd_config will not apply until the application has been reloaded.</mark> This can generally be done by running <code>systemctl reload sshd</code></li>
          <li>If you are running NGINX on a remote server, and want to manage it via SSH:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Key based authentication can be enabled by adding
              <code>
               PubKeyAuthentication yes
              </code>
              to the
              <code>
               /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              </code>
              file. Then run <code>systemctl reload sshd</code>
             </li>
             <li>Disconnect from the remote server.</li>
             <li>Generate an ssh key on your local machine if you dont already have one by running <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096</code>. You should include a password when prompted.</li>
            <li>Use <code>ssh-copy-id personal_account_username@remote-host-ip-or-domain</code> to copy your public ssh key to the server.</li>
            <li>You can now SSH into your personal account on the remote server.</li>
            <li>
              SSH key authentication should be enforced by disabling password authentication by adding
              <code>
               PasswordAuthentication no
              </code>
              to the
              <code>
               /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              </code>
              file.
             </li>
             <li><mark>IMPORTANT:</mark> Update the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file to set the root user's shell to nologin if it is not already. Add <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> to the <code>/etc/shh/sshd_config</code> file to prevent future root logins.</li>
             <li>Run <code>systemctl reload sshd</code></li>
          </ul>
          <li>Be sure to review the information on the <a href="/notes/linux-hardening.html" class="link">Linux Hardening page</a></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Running NGINX</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Install NGINX using your personal account with <code>sudo</code> permissions. For example, <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code></li>
          <li>Specify the user that nginx should run under (this should be the nginx account created preiously) by adding <code>user nginx;</code> to the <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> file. (More on this in the next section)</li>
          <li>Start the NGINX service (usually with a command like <code>sudo systemctl start nginx</code>). NGINX will start with root privileges automatically, but then drop its privileges and run as the user specified.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this setup, there's no need to use <code>setuid</code> to specify a user to run as or <code>sudo -u</code> to switch to the nginx user. NGINX runs as the user specified, and handles the privilege dropping itself.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;"><mark>You should now be able to see a placeholder webpage by navigating to the ip of your server in a web browser.</mark> If you don't know the IP of your system, you can find it by running <code>curl ifconfig.me</code>.</p>
