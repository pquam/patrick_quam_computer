     <li>
      Follow a process for removing user accounts.
     </li>
     <li>
      root has full control over all system processes.
     </li>
     <li>
      Use a firewall (ufw, iptables, dedicated firewall).
     </li>
     <li>
      Use Multi-Factor Authentication wherever possible.
     </li>
     <li>
      NEVER give root access to a user that does not absolutely require it.
     </li>
     <li>
      File permissions make it easy to manage what each user has access too.
     </li>
     <li>
      Linux is less popular than windows ðŸ™‚, and it is open source, so less malware is developed for it.
     </li>
     <li>
      Root is required to install system-wide software, configure networking, &amp; manage users, along with other administrative tasks.
     </li>
     <li>
      Only allow network connections from required sources (for example, only allow incoming traffic from SSH if no other applications require network connectivity).
     </li>
     <li>
      Centralized package managers can certify applications are malware free before they are installed.Package managers also allow users to update all of their software at once.
     </li>
     <li>
      Encrypt all data transmissions over a network. Ensure you are are using the latest versions of protocols to make sure data is encrypted properly. for example, sftp instead of ftp.
     </li>
     <li>
      linux allows you to create dedicated accounts for services &amp; applications.This way, if a service or process becomes compromised, it is less likely to affect the rest of the system.
     </li>
     <li>
      Individuals should always have their own system accounts. Users sharing accounts can make it difficult to find the source of a breach. Users have a bad habit of being less responsible with shared user accounts.
     </li>
     <li>
      Monitor system activity. This means regularly reviewing system logs. Sending logs to a dedicated server can help managing the review process easier, and also means you have a duplicate of logs in case an attacker changes logs on a system.
     </li>
     <li>
      Avoid direct logins to root and service accounts unless absolutely neccessary. Users should log in to their personal accounts then use 'sudo -u' to run commands as other users. This creates a log trail that does not exist if users sign in the application, service, or root accounts.
     </li>
     <li>
      Wherever possible, run applications and services in their own system (container, VM, dedicated physcial hardware).Otherwise, ensure applications and services have their own dedicated user. This way, if an application or service becomes compromised, it is less likely that it will be able to effect the rest of the system.

      Ensure that single user mode is either disabled or password protected. Single user mode can be accessed by restarting the system, and provides root access to the system.
     </li>
     <li>
      Require a boot menu password. Without a boot menu password, attacks can force the bootloader to boot a root shell instead of another aprt of the operating system, providing them with root access. To do so, follow these steps:
     </li>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Open a terminal.
      </li>
      <li>
       Run the command
       <code>
        grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
       </code>
       . You'll be asked to enter the password and then to confirm it. This will create an encrypted password for the bootloader.
      </li>
      <li>
       The command will output a hashed version of the provided password. Copy this.
      </li>
      <li>
       Open the GRUB configuration file with root permissions using a text editor. For example, if you're using vim, you would enter:
       <code>
        sudo vim /etc/default/grub
       </code>
      </li>
      <li>
       Find the line that starts with
       <code>
        GRUB_PASSWORD
       </code>
       . If it doesn't exist, you'll need to add it. You can edit the file by entering insert mode in vim simply by inputting
       <code>
        i
       </code>
       . To exit vim without making changes, hit escape, then enter
       <code>
        :q!
       </code>
       and press enter. Set GRUB_PASSWORD to the hashed password you copied. It should look like this:
       <code>
        GRUB_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.long_string_of_characters
       </code>
      </li>
      <li>
       Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using vim, you can do this by pressing
       <code>
        escape
       </code>
       , then entering
       <code>
        :wq
       </code>
       to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then
       <code>
        Enter
       </code>
       to confirm the file name.
      </li>
      <li>
       Update GRUB with the new configuration by running:
       <code>
        sudo update-grub
       </code>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <li>
      Ensure device encryption is enabled. Requiring a boot password can be circumvented by an attack installing their own boot media and mounting the system. LUKS is a common encryption tool.
     </li>
     <ul class="hidden">
      <li>
       For example, if you are hosting a web server in a cloud instance, ensure the cloud instance is encrypted. additionally, you can run the server in a VM, and make sure the virtual drive for the VM is encrypted.
      </li>
     </ul>

      is a common encryption tool. It can be used to encrypt any block device.
     </li>
     <li>
      Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL. CTRL+ALT+DEL initiates a system reboot. if an attacker is able to gain access to the system they may use the restart to gain access to the bootloader.
     </li>
     <ul class="hidden">

       CTRL+ALT+DEL can be disabled by running

        Sometimes you may want to lock a user account. Maybe the account is compromised, a user no longer needs access, or it is a dedicated account for a service or application. Here are a few ways you can disable logins:
       </li>
       <ul class="hidden">
        <li>
         Changing the final entry in a users line of the
         <code>
          /etc/passwd
         </code>
         file to nologin (default is /bin/bash)
        </li>
        <ul class="hidden">
         <li>
          This can also be done by using the change shell command like this:
          <code>
           chsh -s shell account
          </code>
         </li>
         <li>
          For example,
          <code>
           chsh -s /sbin/nologin foo
          </code>
          would disable logins for the user foo.
         </li>
         <li>
          to re-enable logins, you would run
          <code>
           chsh -s /bin/bash foo
          </code>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
         Another way to lock an account is with the passwd command, although this only prevents the user from logging in using a password. For example, a user would still be able to log in using an SSH key.
        </li>
        <ul class="hidden">
         <li>
          To lock an account:
          <code>

          </code>
         </li>
         <li>

        <li>
         To display all accounts with UID of 0 (root access), run
         <code>
          awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
         </code>
        </li>
        <ul class="hidden">
         <li>
          This command works by using awk, which is a text processing command. The -F: option tells awk to use a colon as the field separator, as fields in the /etc/passwd file are separated by colons. The $3 == 0 part is a condition that checks if the third field (which is the UID) is 0. If this condition is true, awk executes the action in the curly braces, which is to print the first field (the username).
         </li>
         <li>
          Any accounts with a UID of 0 should either be assigned a different UID or be removed.

       ports below 1024 require root privileges to open. If an application must use one of these ports, use root privileges to open the port, then drop the privileges.

       if a server is running on a low port, check the application configuration to see if you can specify a non-root user to perform the work.

      Key based authentication is generally the safest way to use SSH

     <li>
      Key based authentication can be enabled by adding
      <code>
       PubKeyAuthentication yes

      to the
      <code>
       /etc/ssh/sshd_config

      </code>
     </li>
     <ul class="hidden">
      <li>
       When generating a key, it is common to use
       <code>
        ssh-keygen -t
       </code>
       to specify what algorithm to use when generating the key.
      </li>
      <ul class="hidden">
       <li>
        Common algorithm options are rsa and ed25519
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       Another common option when generating a key is
       <code>
        ssh-keygen -b
       </code>
       which is used to specify the number of bits in the key.
      </li>
      <ul class="hidden">
       <li>
        A longer key means it is better protected against brute force attacks, but it also means it is more compute heavy to generate and validate.
       </li>
       <li>
        The typical length is 4096
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       When you generate an ssh key, it will ask you to input a password that will be required when that key is used.
      </li>
      <ul class="hidden">
       <li>
        In some usecases, you may not want to have a password protected key. For example, if you need to automate an SSH connection, it may be unnecessarily complicated to automate password entry.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       When you run ssh-keygen, two files are created in that users  <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory. Those files are id_rsa &amp; id_rsa.pub
      </li>
      <ul class="hidden">
       <li>
        id_rsa is your <mark>private</mark> SSH key. Its permissions should be set so that only the user that generated it can access it.
       </li>
       <li>
        id_rsa.pub is your public SSH key. This will be placed in the remote hosts ~/.ssh/authorized-keys file to grant SSH access to that user.
       </li>
       <li>
        you can add a key to a remote host by running
        <code>
         ssh-copy-id user@host
        </code>
       </li>
       <li>

        <code>
         ssh-copy-id username@1.1.1.1

        or
        <code>
         ssh-copy-id username@mydomain.com
